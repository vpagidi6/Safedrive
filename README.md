# Safedrive
## SafeDrive is an ML-powered system that rewards safe driving and penalizes distracted driving. The system employs computer vision to analyze video feeds from a camera installed in the car. Our model detects signs of distraction, such as texting, drinking, or looking away from the road. The system sends real-time data to a web dashboard for monitoring and intervention, encouraging safer driving practices.
